This is the desiccated remains of an unknown human of unknown gender and station. The body is wearing the outfit of a low-level technician. A nametag reads "Lyr Carter."

The corpse is still clutching a crumpled note. It reads, "There's a little something for our anniversary in my locker. Love you, babe!"
On the reverse side, it reads, "P.S. Remember this the next time you razz me about setting my locker code so that I wouldn't forget the date." There is a simple illustration of a face with one eye closed.

You have no recollection of this individual, nor of any others, but you feel a strange sense of longing as you look on the barely recognizable body.
