This is the desiccated remains of an unknown human of unknown gender and station. The body is wearing the outfit of a low-level technician. A nametag reads "Lyr Carter."

You have no recollection of this individual, nor of any others, but you feel a strange sense of longing as you look on the barely recognizable body.
