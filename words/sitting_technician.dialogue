This is the mummified remains of a technician who died sitting at their desk. They are not wearing a nametag.
On their desk is a printed memo that reads, "Xavi, we went ahead and replaced your locker keypad with a new unit, and it seems to be working much better."
"I've set the passcode to 7777 for now, but I suggest setting your own as soon as possible."
"Once you get your key card back, don't forget to return the spare to security."
=> END
